msgid ""
"Our default theme for 2020 is designed to take full advantage of the "
"flexibility of the block editor. Organizations and businesses have the "
"ability to create dynamic landing pages with endless layouts using the group "
"and column blocks. The centered content column and fine-tuned typography "
"also makes it perfect for traditional blogs. Complete editor styles give you "
"a good idea of what your content will look like, even before you publish. "
"You can give your site a personal touch by changing the background colors "
"and the accent color in the Customizer. The colors of all elements on your "
"site are automatically calculated based on the colors you pick, ensuring a "
"high, accessible color contrast for your visitors."
